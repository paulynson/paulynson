### Hi there 👋

I'm a Frontend Developer and a UI designer who is passionate about creating tech to assist and elevate people around me and beyond.

I love solving complex problems that gives me more idea turning it to something beautiful and eye catching which also gives me the innovation to work with pixels as a great tool of beauty. When I'm not coding, I love playing football or video games.

I like to code things from scratch, and enjoy bringing ideas to life in the browser.

I value simple content structure, clean design patterns, and thoughtful interactions.
