### Hi there 👋

As a passionate Frontend Developer with three years of experience, I specialize in building impactful, responsive web applications using React, Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. My expertise extends to creating clean, scalable code with a focus on crafting seamless, intuitive experiences for users.

Beyond the web, I also have a strong foundation in mobile development through React Native, enabling me to deliver exceptional cross-platform solutions. With a keen eye for detail, I take pride in solving challenges with elegant, aesthetically pleasing interfaces and ensuring that every aspect of a project aligns with my commitment to excellence.

When I’m not coding, you’ll often find me enjoying football or diving into the latest video games. Let’s connect and bring great ideas to life together!
